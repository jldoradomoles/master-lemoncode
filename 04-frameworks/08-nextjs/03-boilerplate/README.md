# 03 Boilerplate

Next.js is unopinionated about how you [organize your project](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation) but it gives you some features to avoid create unnecessary routes like:

- [Private folders](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#private-folders) using underscore as prefix: `_folderName`.

- [Route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#route-groups): `(folderName)` to groups several routes under the same folder without create a new group route.

- Or even [store files outside `app` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#store-project-files-outside-of-app)

- [Using fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)

- [Working on support emotion and MUI](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js)

- [Material Icons discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/42881)

- [Module aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases#module-aliases)
